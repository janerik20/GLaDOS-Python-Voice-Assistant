# GLaDOS-Python-Voice-Assistant
This is a voice assistant created with python. It's a canceled project.
--
It's running on linux and seems to work if you use a NVIDIA graphics card.
--
Also an internet connection is required.
--

You need to install some python libaries via pip and python itself.
--
These are listed in the pip-requirements.txt file.
--
You can easily install them py running the instal-requirements-auto.sh file (open terminal -> cd [folder] -> sudo bash install-requirements-auto.sh)
--
To run the voice assistant, you need to get into the folder (like before: open terminal -> cd [folder] -> sudo bash install-requirements-auto.sh) and run "python3 glados_main.py".
--
If it doesn't run:
--
  Do you have a NVIDIA graphics card? (tested with NVIDIA Geforce RTX 950M)
	--
  Do you use Linux? (Tested with Linux Mint Cinnamon 64-bit Ubuntu-based)
	--
  Did you install the pip requirements and python?
	--

  If this doesn't help:
	--
    Install the pip requirements by yourself by running "sudo apt install python3-[package]" (e.g. "sudo apt install python3-torch"
		--
    Install pytorch ("sudo apt install python3-pytorch" or "pip3 install pytorch")
